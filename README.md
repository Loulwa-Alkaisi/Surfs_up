# ***Surfs_up Analysis***

## **Project Overview:**
We plan on openning a surf and ice cream shop in Hawaii. We conducted this analysis to study the statistical summeries of the temperatures in the months of June and December. This analysis will help us assess the weather in order to make a final decision if the shop will be able to operate based on the weather conditions. 

## **Result:**
The tables below summarizes the temperature statistics in June and December. 

### June:

Based on these table we can see that the average temperatures in the months of June and December are 74.9 and 73 respectively. These averages show a very mild changes in temperature throughout the year. Moreover, the maximum temperatures in both months are relatively similar with only 2 degrees difference. On the other hand, there is a difference in the minimum temperatures. In June the minimum temperature in 64 degrees while in December it is 53 degrees; almost 10 degrees difference. This may indicate that the month of December could have some days that are not suitable for surfing or ice cream. 

## **Summary:**
After analyzing the temperature statistics for June and December, we can say that even though we see the difference in the minimum temperature, in general the two months very similar and close in temperature. 

Additional queries we can run is percipitation in order to study which month has more rain. Additionally, we can run queries to compare the weather stations in order to see which location around Hawaii has the absolute best weather for the ice cream and surfing shop.
